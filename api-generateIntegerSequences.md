generateIntegerSequences (method)

This method generates uniform or multiform sequences of true random integers within user-defined ranges. Uniform sequences all have the same general form (length, range, replacement and base) whereas these characteristics can vary for multiform sequences. Your client must set the method property of its JSON-RPC request object to generateIntegerSequences. The request must also contain an id member, which will be returned in the response.
Required Parameters

The following parameters are mandatory and should be specified in the params array of the JSON-RPC request:

apiKey
    Your API key, which is used to track the true random bit usage for your client. 
n
    An integer specifying the number of sequences requested. Must be within the [1, 1000] range. 
length
    This parameter specifies the lengths of the sequences requested. For uniform sequences, length must be an integer in the [1, 10000] range. For multiform sequences, length can be an array with n integers, each specifying the length of the sequence identified by its index. In this case, each value in length must be within the [1, 10000] range and the total sum of all the lengths must be in the [1, 10000] range. 
min
    This parameter specifies the lower boundaries of the sequences requested. For uniform sequences, min must be an integer in the [-1000000000, 1000000000] range. For multiform sequences, min can be an array with n integers, each specifying the lower boundary of the sequence identified by its index. In this case, each value in min must be within the [-1000000000, 1000000000] range. 
max
    This parameter specifies the upper boundaries of the sequences requested. For uniform sequences, max must be an integer in the [-1000000000, 1000000000] range. For multiform sequences, max can be an array with n integers, each specifying the upper boundary of the sequence identified by its index. In this case, each value in max must be within the [-1000000000, 1000000000] range. 

Optional Parameters

The following parameters are optional and can be included in the params object of your JSON-RPC request if you want functionality that is different from the default:

replacement (default value true)
    This parameter specifies whether the requested sequences should be picked with replacement. When numbers in a sequence are picked with replacement, the sequence may contain duplicate values (like a series of dice rolls). When picked without replacement, the numbers in the sequence will be unique (like raffle tickets drawn from a container). For uniform sequences, replacement must be a Boolean value where true indicates the sequences will be picked with replacement and false indicates that they will not. For multiform sequences, replacement can be an array with n Boolean values, each specifying whether the sequence identified by its index will be created with (true) or without (false) replacement. 
base (default value 10)
    This parameter specifies the base that will be used to display the numbers in the sequences. For uniform sequences, base must be an integer with with one of the values 2, 8, 10 or 16. For multiform sequences, base can be an array with n integer values taken from the same set, each specifying the base that will be used to display the sequence identified by its index. Use of the base parameter affects the JSON types and formatting of the resulting data as discussed in the documentation for the generateIntegers method. 
pregeneratedRandomization (default value null)
    Allows the client to specify that the random values should be generated from a pregenerated, historical randomization instead of a one-time on-the-fly randomization. There are three possible cases:

        If the caller specifies a null value (or does not specify a value), then RANDOM.ORG will generate true randomness specifically for the caller and will discard this randomness immediately after it has been used to generate the random values requested. This is the standard way of using a true random number generator.
        If the caller specifies an object of the form { "date": "YYYY-MM-DD" } where YYYY-MM-DD is a date in ISO 8601 format, then RANDOM.ORG uses historical true randomness generated on the corresponding date. The date must be in the past or the current date in UTC time.
        If the caller specifies an object of the form { "id": "PERSISTENT-IDENTIFIER" } where PERSISTENT-IDENTIFIER is a string, then RANDOM.ORG uses historical true randomness derived from the corresponding identifier in a deterministic manner. The identifier must have a length in the [1, 64] range.

    The two non-null forms for the pregeneratedRandomization parameter causes RANDOM.ORG to generate the random values based on a pregenerated randomization, i.e., historical true randomness generated by RANDOM.ORG at some point in the past. This makes it possible for the client to replay a given sequence of numbers at a later stage, and also allows multiple parties in different locations to get the same numbers in a predictable fashion. These modes effectively turn RANDOM.ORG into a pseudo-random number generator. 

Successful Response

If the numbers were generated successfully, RANDOM.ORG returns a JSON-RPC response with the result property containing an object with the following named values:

random
    This object encapsulates the random numbers and associated data. It contains the following properties.

    data
        An array containing the sequences of numbers requested. The length of the data array will be the same as the length of n from the request, and the order of the sequences is the same as that specified in the request. 
    completionTime
        A string containing the timestamp in ISO 8601 format at which the request was completed. 

bitsUsed
    An integer containing the number of true random bits used to complete this request. 
bitsLeft
    An integer containing the (estimated) number of remaining true random bits available to the client. 
requestsLeft
    An integer containing the (estimated) number of remaining API requests available to the client. 
advisoryDelay
    An integer containing the recommended number of milliseconds that the client should delay before issuing another request. 

For a successful response, the error property is absent.

Simple clients may not necessarily need all of the properties in the response. A minimal client could use only the random.data and advisoryDelay properties and ignore the rest of the response.
Error Response

If an error occurred, RANDOM.ORG returns a JSON-RPC response in which the result property is absent and the error property contains an error object as described in Error Codes and Messages.
Example 1

The following requests six numbers, five from the [1,69] range and one from [1,26]. The replacement parameter for both sequences is set to false, which means the numbers will be picked without replacement, i.e., will not contain duplicate values. This makes them suitable for use as a lottery tickets, for example for US Powerball.

}

The service responds with the following:

        "requestsLeft": 199598,
        "advisoryDelay": 200
    },
    "id": 45673
}

The random object contains the true random values (in the data array) produced as well as the completion time. Note that the completionTime specifies UTC time zone (‘Zulu time’) by the letter ‘Z’ after the clock time. Through the other fields in the result object, RANDOM.ORG also advises how many true random bits were used to satisfy the request and how many bits and requests are left in the client's quota. It also advises the client that it can go ahead and issue the next request with a minimal delay.
Example 2

The following requests eight uniform randomizations of the [1,52] range. The replacement parameter is set to false, meaning the numbers will be picked without replacement, i.e., duplicates will not occur. This makes them suitable to shuffle decks of cards.

    },
    "id": 14478
}

The random object contains the true random numbers (in the data array) produced, as well as the completion time.

The remaining fields in the result object indicate how many true random bits were used to satisfy the request as well as how many bits and requests are left in the client's quota. The response also advises the client preferably to delay for a short time before issuing the next request.
Example 3

The following requests one random number from the [1,8] range and three from the [1,6]. Both sequences are generated with replacement. The numbers could be used as a 1d8+3d6 dice roll. In some fields (min and replacement), the caller gives an array of identical values and in another (base) a single value that will apply for all sequences. The two approaches are equivalent, and both are allowed by the API.

{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "generateIntegerSequences",
    "params": {
        "apiKey": "6b1e65b9-4186-45c2-8981-b77a9842c4f0",
        "n": 2,
        "length": [1, 3],
        "min": [1, 1],
        "max": [8, 6],
        "replacement": [true, true],
        "base": 10
    },
    "id": 4352
}

The service responds with the following:

{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "random": {
            "data": [
                [7],
                [6, 1, 4]
            ],
            "completionTime": "2018-01-29 17:41:11Z"
        },
        "bitsUsed": 11,
        "bitsLeft": 831537,
        "requestsLeft": 199593,
        "advisoryDelay": 200
    },
    "id": 4352
}

The random object contains the random data generated by the server. The client can sum the two sequences in order to get the total for the 1d8+3d6 dice roll.

The service also advises how many true random bits were used to satisfy the request and how many bits and requests are left in the client's quota.
Example 4

As in Example 1 above, the following requests six numbers, five from the [1,69] range and one from [1,26]. Duplicate values are not allowed. The client also specifies a value of type date for the optional pregeneratedRandomization parameter, meaning that the results will be historical true randomness generated by RANDOM.ORG at some point in the past.

{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "generateIntegerSequences",
    "params": {
        "apiKey": "3fcffb4b-62ca-4a5b-b25e-05e27d909182",
        "n": 2,
        "length": [ 5, 1 ],
        "min": 1,
        "max": [ 69, 26 ],
        "replacement": false,
        "base": 10,
        "pregeneratedRandomization": {
            "date": "2010-12-31"
        }
    },
    "id": 12691
}

The service responds with the following:

{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "random": {
            "data": [
                [ 57, 59, 7, 25, 15 ],
                [ 3 ]
            ],
            "completionTime": "2021-03-25 21:46:29Z"
        },
        "bitsUsed": 0,
        "bitsLeft": 246374,
        "requestsLeft": 977,
        "advisoryDelay": 1940
    },
    "id": 12691
}

The random object contains the random integer sequences returned by the server. By asking for pregenerated random values, any request with the same specifications, i.e. the same values for n, length, min, max, replacement and pregeneratedRandomization, will return the same data. This also applies to the equivalent method in the Signed API, see Example 6 of the generateSignedIntegerSequences method.

The service also advises that no bits were used to satisfy the request, as the values are not generated on-the-fly. It also includes how many bits and requests are left in the client's quota.
Example 5

The only difference between this request and that in Example 4, is that the pregeneratedRandomization parameter is supplied with an id value instead of a date value.

{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "generateIntegerSequences",
    "params": {
        "apiKey": "3fcffb4b-62ca-4a5b-b25e-05e27d909182",
        "n": 2,
        "length": [ 5, 1 ],
        "min": 1,
        "max": [ 69, 26 ],
        "replacement": false,
        "base": 10,
        "pregeneratedRandomization": {
            "id": "foobar"
        }
    },
    "id": 12691
}

The service responds with the following:

{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "random": {
            "data": [
                [ 59, 7, 63, 49, 69 ],
                [ 6 ]
            ],
            "completionTime": "2021-03-25 21:47:52Z"
        },
        "bitsUsed": 0,
        "bitsLeft": 246374,
        "requestsLeft": 976,
        "advisoryDelay": 1930
    },
    "id": 12691
}

As in Example 4, the values in the data object were generated at some point in the past and any time a request with the same parameters is sent, the data returned will be identical.
